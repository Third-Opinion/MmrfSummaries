NCT06171685,MMRC Horizon One Adaptive Platform Trial Evaluating Therapies in RRMM,"This trial is an adaptive platform trial. The structure of the protocol allows the trial to evolve over time. Multiple investigational arms will be included within the trial under a Master Protocol (MP). These investigational arms may be added as appendices at different times depending on whether they are trial-ready and whether accrual in the trial will support another arm. Accrual to an arm will terminate in accord with the arm's appendix to the Master Protocol.

The purpose of this proposed structure is to support the recurrent research challenge of efficiently evaluating what is the best therapy for a particular patient.",Relapse Multiple Myeloma; Refractory Multiple Myeloma,DRUG: Teclistamab Monotherapy; DRUG: Teclistamab,18 Years to 99 Years,ALL
NCT06158841,Study Assessing Activity of Intravenous (IV) Etentamig Monotherapy Versus Standard Available Therapies in Adult Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of the blood's plasma cells. The cancer is typically found in the bones and bone marrow (the spongy tissue inside of the bones) and can cause bone pain, fractures, infections, weaker bones, and kidney failure. Treatments are available, but MM can come back (relapsed) or may not get better (refractory) with treatment. This is a study to determine change in disease symptoms of etentamig compared to standard available therapies in adult participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) MM.

Etentamig is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of R/R MM. This study is broken into 2 Arms; Arm A and Arm B. In Arm A, participants will receive etentamig as a monotherapy. In Arm B, participants will receive the standard available therapy (SAT) identified by the Investigator during screening, in accordance with the local (or applicable) approved label, package insert, summary of product characteristics, and/or the institutional guidelines, as applicable. Around 380 adult participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma will be enrolled at approximately 140 sites across the world.

In Arm A participants will receive etentamig as an infusion into the vein in 28 day cycles, during the 3.5 year study duration. In Arm B, participants will receive the SAT identified by the Investigator during screening, in accordance with the local (or applicable) approved label, package insert, summary of product characteristics, and/or the institutional guidelines, as applicable, during the 3.5 year study duration.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and questionnaires.",Multiple Myeloma,DRUG: Etentamig; DRUG: Carfilzomib; DRUG: Pomalidomide; DRUG: Elotuzumab; DRUG: Selinexor; DRUG: Bortezomib; DRUG: Dexamethasone,18 Years to N/A,ALL
