# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Progress Reporting System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a progress reporting system that provides real-time feedback on processing status as specified in the UX requirements.
# Details:
1. Create a ProgressReporter class with methods:
   - StartProcess(int totalRows): Initializes a new process
   - UpdateProgress(int currentRow, string status): Updates progress display
   - CompleteProcess(): Finalizes and shows summary statistics
2. Implement a progress bar visualization using console characters
3. Display current processing information:
   - Current row / total rows
   - Current trial NCDID
   - Status of summary generation with timing
4. Track and display summary statistics:
   - Total processed rows
   - Successful rows
   - Failed rows
   - Total processing time
   - Average time per row
5. Support verbose mode with additional details
6. Ensure progress display works correctly when processing is interrupted

# Test Strategy:
1. Test progress calculations with various row counts
2. Verify display formatting in different console environments
3. Test with mock processing to ensure timing calculations are accurate
4. Verify summary statistics are calculated correctly
5. Test verbose mode output
