        "details": "Implement a SQL script generator with the following specifications:\n\n1. Create a new module named `sql_generator.py` that will handle the SQL script generation.\n\n2. The module should:\n   - Accept a path to the CSV file as input\n   - Read the CSV file using pandas or csv module\n   - Parse each row to extract the nct_id, summary, and short_summary fields\n   - Generate SQL UPDATE statements in the format:\n     ```sql\n     UPDATE nlp_extensions \n     SET summary = 'generated_summary_text', \n         short_summary = 'generated_short_summary_text' \n     WHERE nct_id = 'specific_nct_id';\n     ```\n   - Handle proper SQL escaping for special characters in the summary text (e.g., single quotes)\n   - Write the generated SQL statements to an output file (e.g., 'update_summaries.sql')\n\n3. Implementation considerations:\n   - Ensure proper error handling for file operations (reading CSV, writing SQL)\n   - Validate that the CSV contains the required columns before processing\n   - Add logging to track the number of SQL statements generated\n   - Include progress indicators for large CSV files\n   - Consider implementing batch processing for very large files\n   - Add comments to the generated SQL file indicating when it was generated and from which source file\n\n4. Create a command-line interface to run the generator:\n   ```\n   python sql_generator.py --input path/to/summaries.csv --output path/to/update_statements.sql\n   ```\n\n5. Add appropriate documentation in the code and a README section explaining how to use the SQL generator.",

Manual Verification:\n   - Review a sample of generated SQL statements to ensure they follow the correct format\n   - Check that special characters are properly escaped\n   - Verify the SQL file includes appropriate comments and metadata\n\n4. Performance Testing:\n   - Test with a large CSV file (e.g., 10,000+ rows) to ensure the generator handles it efficiently\n   - Measure and optimize processing time if necessary\n\n5.
