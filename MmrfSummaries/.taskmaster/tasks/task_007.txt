# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Main Trial Summarizer Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core TrialSummarizer class that coordinates the overall processing workflow.
# Details:
1. Create the TrialSummarizer class with methods:
   - ProcessTrials(string inputFile, string outputFile, int? rowLimit): Main processing method
   - ProcessSingleTrial(TrialRecord record): Processes a single trial record
2. Implement the main workflow:
   - Load configuration
   - Read input CSV
   - Process each record (generate summaries)
   - Write enhanced output CSV
   - Report progress and results
3. Add error handling for each processing stage
4. Implement batch processing with the specified row limit
5. Track processing statistics
6. Coordinate between components:
   - CsvProcessor
   - ClaudeApiClient
   - ProgressReporter
   - Logging
7. Implement graceful shutdown on interruption
8. Add resume capability to continue from last successful row

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test the workflow with mock dependencies
2. Test error handling for various failure scenarios
3. Verify batch processing with different row limits
4. Test interruption and resume functionality
5. Verify correct coordination between components
6. Test end-to-end processing with sample data
