# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Logging System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive logging system that records application activity, errors, and processing details.
# Details:
1. Configure Microsoft.Extensions.Logging for the application
2. Implement log levels:
   - Information: Normal processing events
   - Warning: Non-critical issues
   - Error: Processing failures
   - Debug: Detailed information for troubleshooting
3. Create console logging for immediate feedback
4. Implement file logging for persistent records
5. Log key events:
   - Application start/stop
   - Configuration loading
   - File operations
   - API requests and responses (excluding sensitive data)
   - Processing successes and failures
6. Create structured logging for machine-readable output
7. Ensure no API keys or sensitive information is logged
8. Implement log rotation for large processing jobs

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify logs are created with correct format and content
2. Test log level filtering
3. Ensure sensitive information is not logged
4. Verify log file creation and rotation
5. Test logging performance under heavy load
