# Task ID: 9
# Title: Optimize Performance and Resource Usage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the application to meet performance requirements and efficiently manage resources.
# Details:
1. Implement performance monitoring:
   - Track processing time per record
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Log API response times
2. Optimize CSV processing:
   - Use streaming for large files
   - Implement efficient memory management
3. Enhance API client performance:
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Optimize HTTP request/response handling
4. Add rate limiting controls:
   - Configurable request throttling
   - Adaptive rate limiting based on API responses
5. Optimize memory usage:
   - Avoid loading entire CSV into memory
   - Process records in batches
   - Implement proper disposal of resources
6. Add performance-related configuration options:
   - Batch size
   - Thread count
   - Memory limits
7. Implement cancellation support for long-running operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Benchmark processing speed with various dataset sizes
2. Test memory usage with large files (10,000+ rows)
3. Verify rate limiting effectiveness
4. Test performance under different configuration settings
5. Measure API throughput and optimize accordingly
6. Test cancellation and resource cleanup
