NCT06171685,MMRC Horizon One Adaptive Platform Trial Evaluating Therapies in RRMM,"This trial is an adaptive platform trial. The structure of the protocol allows the trial to evolve over time. Multiple investigational arms will be included within the trial under a Master Protocol (MP). These investigational arms may be added as appendices at different times depending on whether they are trial-ready and whether accrual in the trial will support another arm. Accrual to an arm will terminate in accord with the arm's appendix to the Master Protocol.

The purpose of this proposed structure is to support the recurrent research challenge of efficiently evaluating what is the best therapy for a particular patient.",Relapse Multiple Myeloma; Refractory Multiple Myeloma,DRUG: Teclistamab Monotherapy; DRUG: Teclistamab,18 Years to 99 Years,ALL,This is an adaptive platform trial for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma that uses a Master Protocol structure allowing multiple investigational treatment arms (including teclistamab) to be added or removed over time based on enrollment and readiness. The trial's flexible design aims to efficiently evaluate the best therapies for individual patients with this condition.,"The MMRC Horizon One Adaptive Platform Trial (NCT06171685) is an innovative clinical study designed to efficiently evaluate optimal therapies for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). This adaptive platform trial employs a flexible Master Protocol structure that allows multiple investigational treatment arms to be added or modified over time as new therapies become trial-ready and as patient accrual supports additional arms. The trial's adaptive design enables it to evolve continuously, with individual arms terminating according to their specific protocols, addressing the critical research challenge of determining the most effective personalized treatment approaches for RRMM patients.

The study targets adults aged 18-99 years of all genders who have relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, with current interventions focusing on teclistamab, both as monotherapy and in combination regimens. The platform's structure is specifically designed to maximize efficiency in therapeutic evaluation by allowing simultaneous testing of multiple treatment strategies under a unified protocol framework. This approach represents a significant advancement in clinical trial methodology for multiple myeloma, as it can rapidly incorporate emerging therapies and adapt to new scientific developments while maintaining rigorous clinical trial standards, ultimately aiming to accelerate the identification of optimal treatment sequences and combinations for this challenging hematologic malignancy."
NCT06158841,Study Assessing Activity of Intravenous (IV) Etentamig Monotherapy Versus Standard Available Therapies in Adult Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of the blood's plasma cells. The cancer is typically found in the bones and bone marrow (the spongy tissue inside of the bones) and can cause bone pain, fractures, infections, weaker bones, and kidney failure. Treatments are available, but MM can come back (relapsed) or may not get better (refractory) with treatment. This is a study to determine change in disease symptoms of etentamig compared to standard available therapies in adult participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) MM.

Etentamig is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of R/R MM. This study is broken into 2 Arms; Arm A and Arm B. In Arm A, participants will receive etentamig as a monotherapy. In Arm B, participants will receive the standard available therapy (SAT) identified by the Investigator during screening, in accordance with the local (or applicable) approved label, package insert, summary of product characteristics, and/or the institutional guidelines, as applicable. Around 380 adult participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma will be enrolled at approximately 140 sites across the world.

In Arm A participants will receive etentamig as an infusion into the vein in 28 day cycles, during the 3.5 year study duration. In Arm B, participants will receive the SAT identified by the Investigator during screening, in accordance with the local (or applicable) approved label, package insert, summary of product characteristics, and/or the institutional guidelines, as applicable, during the 3.5 year study duration.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and questionnaires.",Multiple Myeloma,DRUG: Etentamig; DRUG: Carfilzomib; DRUG: Pomalidomide; DRUG: Elotuzumab; DRUG: Selinexor; DRUG: Bortezomib; DRUG: Dexamethasone,18 Years to N/A,ALL,This is a 3.5-year clinical trial comparing the investigational drug etentamig to standard available therapies in approximately 380 adult participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The study will evaluate whether etentamig monotherapy can improve disease symptoms compared to current standard treatments across approximately 140 global sites.,"This Phase 3 randomized controlled trial (NCT06158841) is evaluating the efficacy of etentamig, an investigational intravenous monotherapy, compared to standard available therapies in adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM). Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer affecting plasma cells that commonly causes bone pain, fractures, infections, and kidney complications, with current treatments often failing due to disease relapse or resistance. The study aims to enroll approximately 380 adult participants across 140 global sites, randomizing them into two arms: Arm A receiving etentamig monotherapy and Arm B receiving standard available therapy (SAT) as determined by investigators according to local guidelines and approved treatments.

The methodology involves a 3.5-year study duration with 28-day treatment cycles, where participants in Arm A receive intravenous etentamig infusions while those in Arm B receive investigator-selected standard therapies including carfilzomib, pomalidomide, elotuzumab, selinexor, bortezomib, or dexamethasone combinations. The target population consists of adults (18+ years) of all genders with R/R MM who have previously received treatment but experienced disease progression or inadequate response. Participants will undergo regular hospital or clinic visits for comprehensive monitoring including medical assessments, blood tests, adverse event evaluation, and quality-of-life questionnaires, with the primary objective being to assess changes in disease symptoms and overall treatment efficacy compared to current standard care options."
